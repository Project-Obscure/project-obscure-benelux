# project-obscure-benelux

A community-driven collection of parsers for regional applications used in Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg that are not commonly covered by commercial digital forensics tools like Cellebrite UFED, Magnet AXIOM, and others.

🎯Project Purpose

Commercial forensic tools excel at parsing internationally popular applications (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram), but regional and niche apps remain largely unsupported. Project Obscure Benelux focuses on filling this gap for the Benelux region.
This project is intended for:

- Digital forensics practitioners and researchers
- Incident response teams
- Law enforcement with proper authorization
- Academic research and education
- Security professionals conducting authorized investigations

🌍 Why Benelux?
We're starting with the Benelux region to:

- Build a focused, manageable collection
- Serve investigators working in Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg
- Create templates and standards that can expand to other regions
- Develop a community around regional forensic needs
